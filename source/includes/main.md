# Introduction

Welcome to the Weave API. Use our API to monetize your links, track sales that come through links, or track rich click data on those that click on your links.

Our links allow you to pass sub_ids so that all of your users can be individually tracked.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('SAMPLE_API_TOKEN')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('SAMPLE_API_TOKEN')
```

```bash
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.weavesocial.com"
  -H "weave-api-token: SAMPLE_API_TOKEN"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('SAMPLE_API_TOKEN');
```

> Make sure to replace `SAMPLE_API_TOKEN` with your API token.

Weave uses an API token to authenticate your requests to your account.

All API requests must include this token in the header of the request:

`weave-api-token: SAMPLE_API_TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>SAMPLE_API_TOKEN</code> with your personal API key.
